            <h2>What are the causes and treatment principles of cancer in Chinese herbs?
Chinese herbal medicine believes that cancer is an accumulation of toxic and Qi, so treatment of cancer requires dispersal of the poison and dispersal of qi!
Treatments to disperse the poison are the Chinese herbs like Baiwashekao and Scutellaria indica. Of course, there are many prescriptions for Chinese herbs to nourish the internal organs and boost immunity.
However, the current weakness of Chinese herbs is the lack of treatment plans to disperse Qi.
Nowadays China's cancer treatment program is a combination of Chinese and Western methods. However, the mortality rate is very high and the survival rate is less than 15%.
What is Qi, Qi is an accumulation of energy. We believe that if our bodycannot disperse the energy stores in the body and form cancer! Qi radiates from the surface of the body and limbs.
So bathing in cold water is a way to breathe. Every time you take a bath with cold water, you lie quietly on the bed and caress your cold body. If your body does not warm up in about 20 minutes, you will find that it is blocked by blood vessels and meridians, and you will strengthen your massage on the cold place! Then you can disperse Qi.
Also do a lot massage to your fingers can also disperse Qi,because Qi radiates from the surface of the body and limbs.
in a words, cancer is a lack of balance of your body,Due to nervousness and physical and chemical stimulation caused by intense nerve movement and abnormal discharge, it is caused by not being relieved.</h2>

                    <p>Two parts of the body are "itchy". Don't mistake it for an allergy or a sign of liver cancer. Be alert</p>
                    <h3>The liver is the "first of the five internal organs". It can not only synthesize, secrete, and metabolize, but also detoxify and detoxify, which is very important to the human body.
However, the liver is also a well-known "painless" organ. If it is abnormal, it will not feel particularly obvious. Therefore, in order to effectively care for the health of the liver, in addition to having a good diet and living habits, we must also pay more attention to abnormalities in the body, or to quickly find liver disease.

Two parts of the body are "itchy". Don't mistake it for an allergy or a sign of liver cancer. Be alert
1. Itchy skin
Skin itching is generally considered to be caused by allergies or mosquito bites, but if itching occurs suddenly within a period of time, or it is a signal before liver cancer is coming, pay attention.
After the liver disease occurs, the body's metabolic capacity will be reduced to a certain extent, and the bile cannot be smoothly sent to the intestines and stomach to help digestion. When too much cholestasis is accumulated in the gallbladder, a part of it will enter the blood and follow the blood circulation throughout the body. When the bile salts in the bile take the opportunity to gather under the skin, it will stimulate the nerve endings and cause inexplicable itching of the skin.

2. Itchy eyes
Eyes are the weaker parts of the body. If you use your eyes for a long time and do not pay attention to rest, your eyes will become dry and itchy. However, if you use your eyes normally, your eyes will still be abnormal, or liver cancer will come to your home.
After the liver develops a problem, the blood storage capacity will decrease, and the liver blood will be insufficient, so that the eyes will not receive sufficient blood nourishment, and the eyes will appear dry and itchy.

Why is liver cancer more and more? The doctor said bluntly: these 3 foods are not superficial to the liver, so avoid them as soon as possible
1. Moldy food
Moldy food is a gathering place for a large number of bacteria and fungi, and it also contains a strong carcinogen aflatoxin. If you encounter this kind of food, don't be reluctant to throw it away. Just cut off the moldy place and continue eating the rest. This will pose a serious safety hazard.
Studies have shown that intake of 1 mg of aflatoxin will cause a large number of liver cell deaths and liver disease. For good health, always pay attention to throw away moldy food as soon as possible.

2. Long-bubble fungi
Fungus, which contains a lot of nutrients, is also a food that people often eat. However, attention should be paid to the way of eating this kind of food. Improper way of eating will make it a "liver-damaging weapon."
For example, the common fungus is bought dry in general households and soaked when eating. However, if the soaking time is too long, it is easy to be contaminated by bacteria in the air and breed the toxic substance rice yeast. Once this substance enters the human body, it will cause great damage to the liver, causing massive lesions and necrosis of liver cells, and in severe cases, liver cancer.

3. Alcoholic drinks
Alcohol is a must-have drink for social occasions, but if you don’t control the amount of alcohol you drink, it will also cause great damage to your liver.
The liver is the main place for alcohol metabolism. 90% of the alcohol you drink can be catabolized and metabolized with the help of the liver. If you drink frequently, the liver will be overloaded with work and liver function will be affected. In addition, the main ingredient in wine is ethanol. After it enters the human body and is decomposed, it will form acetaldehyde that can damage liver cells and cause rapid liver disease.

The most important thing is to prevent the liver as early as possible. It is recommended to do these 3 things
1. Drink plenty of water
Drinking water can replenish body fluids and create a humid metabolic environment for the liver, allowing the liver to work efficiently. Drinking plenty of water can also help repair liver cells and make the liver healthier.
For people with poor liver, the effect of drinking plain water is not high. You can also put two or three PTZ ice chrysanthemums in the water cup to double the effect.
Yuntai ice chrysanthemum is a subspecies of Huai chrysanthemum produced in the ancient Huaiqing Mansion (Jiaozuo, Henan). It contains selenium, choline, flavonoids and other liver-nourishing ingredients. It is also known as the "king of chrysanthemum".

Medical certificate:
Selenium can accelerate the metabolism of toxins, increase the metabolic rate of the liver, and protect liver health;
Choline can quickly metabolize fat and reduce the burden on the liver. It is known as a "hepatic expert";
Flavonoids can quickly scavenge free radicals in the body and reduce the chance of liver cell damage.
Drinking 1 cup every day after meals can help the liver to metabolize faster and effectively improve liver function. The liver will appreciate you.


2. Exercise more
Exercise is good for the body. Regular exercise can not only promote blood circulation, quickly clear out garbage and toxins in the body, reduce siltation, but also improve the liver's ability to resist harmful substances and reduce the chance of liver disease.
It is best to stick to one hour of exercise every day, and choose aerobic exercises that suit you, such as running, yoga, Tai Chi, etc. These exercises are relatively low in intensity, and can quickly consume excess fat and have a good liver maintenance effect. .

3. Eat a balanced diet and eat less greasy
As the saying goes: All diseases come out of the mouth, and the development of scientific eating habits is of great benefit to the body.
In normal meals, you should ensure a balanced intake of various nutrients. Don't be picky eaters, don't eat too oily, and try to eat more vegetables. Vegetables contain a lot of cellulose, which can help the body digest, expel fat and garbage in the body, reduce the burden on the liver, and maintain liver vitality.

            <h3>Are there any toxic side effects in taking Chinese medicine for a long time? Cancer patients who have eaten for more than ten years...


Regarding this problem, our Chinese medicine practitioners pay attention to good results and do not change the prescription.

Because after taking this medicine for a month or two or three or five months, if the patient rechecks the tumor size to stabilize or shrink, then we think this medicine is still more suitable for you and will make you stick to the medicine. If there are changes in symptoms and conditions, we will adjust the medicine for you. It's like a targeted drug of western medicine. If it doesn't have drug resistance, it won't be changed. Why change? After changing, they may not adapt. We also have a patient who asks to change prescriptions every week. He said to me to adjust it a little bit if it is uncomfortable and a little bit uncomfortable. As a result, I found that I didn’t adapt for the first two or three days after each adjustment, and then he adapted again. . Later, a leader gave him a synthesis and did not change, and slowly he asked not to transfer, and he continued to eat.

I have a patient with a relatively large malignant tumor in the bronchus. At the beginning, I cried and cried every time. My daughter came with her every month. After taking Chinese medicine for two years, I said it’s okay. coming. Her daughter is now helping to dispense the medicine. Every time I watch her video, her face is ruddy, her tongue coating is also very good, and the tumor shrinks after the hospital review. For patients who are stable in all aspects like this, there is no need to change the prescription.

Are there any side effects of taking Chinese medicine for a long time?



As the saying goes, medicine is three points poison, but if it is right, it is not poison, and if it is wrong, it is poison. For example, if your body is irritable and yang is hyperactive, then if you eat ginseng, it will become poison; if you eat rhubarb if your yang is hyperactive and your stools are dry and clumpy, if you give you rhubarb, you will feel comfortable and rhubarb will become a tonic. , So the symptomatically suitable for you is not poison.

Many Chinese medicines are both medicinal and food. Long-term use is no problem. Even if some Chinese medicines that are harmful to the body or have toxic side effects after long-term use, we will be very cautious in processing and dosage. If the patient takes a few times When the situation improves, we will withdraw from the prescription. Generally, we will use milder drugs that are both anti-tumor and non-harmful.

Why it is better to treat tumors with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine



Tumor is a highly difficult disease to treat. Tumors develop relatively quickly. With only Western medicine, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy, the treatment process of this disease may not persist. For example, if you are dying after surgery, if you can restore your righteousness after taking Chinese medicine, you can also achieve a goal in treating tumors. There are also some tumors that cannot be operated, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Taking Chinese medicine is also a good choice because you can take Chinese medicine. You can go for surgery when you are well.

In addition, some tumors may take a long time to recover after only taking Chinese medicine, or the tumor may progress very quickly, and it may not be controlled by taking Chinese medicine alone. Then there are three axes of Western medicine that we can use. The good things of our Chinese medicine are also used by Western medicine. For example, arsenic trioxide injection for the treatment of leukemia is extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine arsenic. In addition, paclitaxel in western medicine is also extracted from yew, so western medicine targeted drugs for radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be used in Chinese medicine.

Modern Chinese medicine cannot simply emphasize that our Chinese medicine is better, because two fists are better than one fist. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are like two legs of a person. Walking on two legs is definitely better than one leg. Therefore, in the process of treating tumors, we will make comprehensive considerations according to the changes in the condition and the needs of the condition. For some who can be operated, we recommend that they be treated after surgery. For example, the effect of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is very good. We will recommend that he first take radiotherapy and then take traditional Chinese medicine. Leukemia and lymphoma are effective for chemotherapy. Then chemotherapy first, then traditional Chinese medicine or chemotherapy while taking traditional Chinese medicine can achieve better treatment goals. .

Our treatment is to put the patient's recovery first. So we often tell patients that whether a white cat or a black cat catches a mouse is a good cat.</h3>

                    <p>How to judge that there is cancer in the body?.</p>
                    <p>There is cancer in the body, and there are often three signs in the abdomen. If you have all of them, it indicates that it is time for a physical examination



Which parts of the body have the most organs? There is no doubt that it is the abdomen. Because it has the most organs, the abdomen is also the site with the most cancers, such as stomach cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, bile duct cancer, small bowel cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, Kidney cancer, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer are all cancers of the abdomen.

The question is, since there are so many cancers in the abdomen, how can we identify them? Which signs should be paid special attention to?

First, abdominal pain. Over time, the most common symptom caused by cancer in the abdomen is abdominal pain. The nature, location, degree of abdominal pain caused by cancer in different parts of the body are also different with or without radiating pain, such as liver cancer. Right upper abdominal pain, pancreatic cancer often causes upper-middle abdominal pain, liver cancer is often accompanied by right shoulder pain, and pancreatic cancer is often accompanied by low back pain.



Second, abdominal masses. As the cancer progresses, masses will form in the abdomen. For example, when liver cancer comes, there will be masses in the upper right abdomen. For example, when colorectal cancer comes, there will be masses in the right lower abdomen or left lower abdomen. Masses, masses caused by malignant tumors, have a hard texture, often unclear borders, and poor mobility. At this time, we must be alert to malignant tumors and it is best to check in time.

Third, ascites. Many patients find malignant tumors because of unexplained ascites. Malignant tumors such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer can all cause ascites. This kind of abdominal effusion Effusion is often malignant. If pathological examination of ascites is performed, malignant tumor cells can often be found.

If there are three of the above three signs, it indicates that the physical examination is required. There are many options for abdominal examination, such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, abdominal CT, MRI, and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Cancer can be found.

Abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT, and MRI can help find malignant tumors of the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, urinary system and ovary. Gastroscopy can help find gastric cancer, and colonoscopy can help find colorectal cancer.

                    <h1>the advantage of chinese medicine for cancer cure.</h1>
                    <h3>Cancer can be cured by taking a few Chinese medicines? Come and see the truth

As far as current medical technology is concerned, the commonly used treatment method for cancer is chemotherapy. The same facts have proved that this is also a very effective method, but it will bring indelible harm to the patient’s psychology and physiology, and it will regularly Quantitative chemotherapy treatment will also bring considerable financial pressure to the family. However, Chinese medicine is very cheap and popular, and it is also sold in general pharmacies.


Generally, people who receive chemotherapy will lose their hair, because the body cannot withstand such high-intensity treatment. Chemotherapy is equivalent to changing blood. The effect is obvious, but the possibility of recurrence is also high. The most important thing is There will be greater harm to the person's own physical condition, and every time they receive such high-intensity treatment, the patient's psychology will also be under great pressure.



So are there any other easy and effective ways to prevent and control cancer?

Our traditional Chinese medicine is also very powerful, and the anti-cancer anti-cancer medicine advocated by Chinese medicine has obvious effects in the prevention and control of cancer. Although traditional Chinese medicine is not as effective as Western medical methods such as chemotherapy, and the prevention and control of traditional Chinese medicine is a gradual process for cancer prevention and control, it has to be said that it does not do so much harm to the body, and because traditional Chinese medicine is made of pure herbs, it is It is purely natural and pollution-free, so the human body will not have such a big rejection reaction to it.

Another disadvantage of Western medicine is that most of its drugs are dependent. If you use Western medicine for treatment for a long time, your body will often have strong resistance to that medicine. Without its medicinal effect, the therapeutic effect is not great.



And Chinese medicine is just the opposite. Chinese medicine needs to be taken for a long time, and it has a good break-in time with the human body, because traditional Chinese medicine is mainly to slowly adjust the human body during the long-term taking process, so that the human body It can produce anti-cancer substances by itself. This kind of treatment is generally more complete and the chance of recurrence is less. However, because it requires a longer treatment time, it is generally necessary to treat with Chinese medicine at the early stage of the onset. It is at the stage of preventing cancer.


The medicinal properties of traditional Chinese medicine are relatively mild, and have excellent effects on the treatment and prevention of cancer. Therefore, we can also drink some Chinese herbal medicines to nourish the body, improve our own resistance, and improve the ability to prevent cancer, so that terrible cancers can no longer be used. There are opportunities.

Of course, when we choose the Chinese herbal medicines we want to drink, we must go to a professional doctor for consultation, and ask professional doctors to formulate a prescription that suits us. But "the medicine is three-point poison", so we also drink Chinese herbal medicines. Be sure to keep his amount within one range and not eat too much at once.

After Mr. Liu was diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer, although many treatment methods such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted drug therapy were adopted, none of these methods ultimately saved Mr. Liu’s life. Only half a year after his diagnosis, Mr. Liu passed away. .



Advanced colorectal cancer, only half a year from diagnosis to death, the doctor said, most advanced colorectal cancer patients, the survival rate of more than half a year is actually very low, this is because cancer cells have metastasized widely, and colorectal cancer is the most easily metastatic site It is the liver. For the human body, the role of the liver is very important. When liver metastases occur, the quality of life of the patient will not only decrease significantly, but also manifestations such as jaundice, ascites, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain.







Speaking of this, many people will ask, if symptoms occur, it seems that they cannot be delayed. If it is bowel cancer, it is easy to metastasize.



First, blood in the stool. Once there is blood in the stool, the first reaction of many people is hemorrhoids. In fact, colon cancer can also cause it, especially rectal cancer, which can easily cause blood in the stool, or even bleeding after the stool. Misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids.



Second, changes in stool characteristics. When bowel cancer comes, it is easy to cause changes in stool characteristics. The main manifestation is that the stool becomes thinner and looks like thin strips, like squeezed toothpaste.



Third, changes in bowel habits. When bowel cancer comes, many patients will also experience changes in bowel habits, manifested as irregular bowel movements, increased stool frequency, and decreased stool frequency.



Fourth, abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia, bowel cancer can cause a series of systemic manifestations, such as abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia.



So far, the best way to diagnose bowel cancer is colonoscopy. For those with the above four symptoms, no matter what they are, it is best to check in time.</h3>

            <h2>The colon has started to become cancerous, and there will be four signs in the stool. If you have all four, it is time for a physical examination



There is one type of cancer that must not be ignored, and that is colon cancer. Data shows that the incidence of colon cancer in our country firmly occupies the third place among malignant tumors, known as the third oldest cancer.

So the question is, when colon cancer comes, what special signs will the body have?

Many people do not know the main function of the colon. After the food passes through the small intestine, almost all the nutrients in the food have been absorbed. The remaining food residue reaches the colon. The colon further absorbs the water and electrolytes in it, and the rest is with Intestinal mucus and bacteria in the intestine together form the human feces, which are eventually excreted.

Since the colon is the place where stool is produced and discharged, when the colon begins to become cancerous, it is often abnormal.



First, the stool is bloody and the mass in the colon is often like cauliflower. Malignant masses are easy to bleed. When the stool passes through the cancerous part, it is easy to cause bleeding due to friction. However, bleeding and hemorrhoids caused by colon cancer are still caused It is different. Bleeding caused by colon cancer is often mixed with blood and stool, while bleeding caused by hemorrhoids is bleeding after the stool.

Second, the stool becomes thinner. As time goes by, the colon lumps become larger and larger, and the lumps block the intestinal cavity. When the stool passes, it is easy to become thinner. This is also the change in the stool characteristics described by the doctor.

Third, it is difficult to pass stool. For the same reason, because the lumps block the intestinal cavity, many people will feel that it is more and more difficult to pass stool over time. If the intestinal cavity is completely blocked, stool cannot pass through, which will also cause The anus stops defecation and exhaust.

Fourth, the bowel habits change. When colon cancer comes, there will be changes in bowel habits. The originally regular bowel habits may suddenly become very irregular. Some patients have fewer bowel movements, and some have more bowel movements.

If you have all the above four signs, you must pay attention to it. Colon cancer is a highly malignant cancer. If it is not detected in time, distant metastasis may occur.</h2>

      <h3>Cancer is not terrible, it is terrible that cancer cells will spread! If these 4 phenomena occur, seek medical attention immediately</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Cancer is not terrible, it is terrible that cancer cells will spread! If these 4 phenomena occur, seek medical attention immediately



The scary thing about cancer is that it is more difficult to cure, because after cancer cells appear in the body, there are usually no obvious symptoms in the early stage, and they are often ignored. When the obvious symptoms appear, the cancer cells have spread and the disease has already reached the stage. In the late stage, it is more difficult to treat at this time.

Even after some cancer cells spread, they basically lose the meaning of treatment. In fact, many cancers have signals when they spread. If you can catch these signals, you can have a ray of life. So what are the signs of cancer cell spread?



1. Lumps appear on the body and keep growing

In the early stage of cancer cell development, the tumor may be relatively small and difficult to find. When the tumor slowly grows up, pay attention to observation. This may be a symptom of the spread of cancer cells, and the disease may have reached the middle to late stage.

Usually, any part of the body, such as the breast, abdomen, or neck, has some swelling, and it gradually grows larger. No matter how small or how big it is, you must go to the hospital for examination in time.

2. The pigmented moles of the body are abnormal

Almost everyone will have pigmented moles, and some moles will not change, then these are benign, but some moles will suddenly enlarge, and even have symptoms of pus or bleeding. This is a common melanoma.

Melanoma will quickly spread to the liver and lungs in a short period of time, causing serious damage to the body. Therefore, some moles on the body are found to have uneven edges, and the surface is rough, and accompanied by a burning sensation. , It is necessary to go to the dermatology department of a regular hospital for examination in time, and start treatment in time after the cause is clear.



3. If cancer cells spread, there will be pain in different parts

When the cancer cells in the body spread, there will be pain.

For example, after liver cancer has spread and metastasized, the tumor will stretch and compress the liver capsule, and the patient will experience dull pain in the upper right abdomen. In addition, gastric cancer patients are caring patients, and if the anastomosis recurs, there will be dull upper abdominal pain.

Therefore, when there are some unexplained pains, it is best to go to the hospital for CT examination.

4. Appetite decreased significantly

Studies have found that about 33% to 75% of patients will have symptoms of anorexia, and during the development of cancer, the incidence of anorexia will reach 80%, so there is a decrease in appetite, so you can also go to the hospital for examination in advance. Prevent the spread of cancer cells.

In addition, the spread of cancer cells also has certain conditions. The phenomenon of metastasis and spread may only occur within 1 to 2 cm, and the cancer will not metastasize in the early stage of the disease.



In summary, the above four signs will appear after cancer cells have spread, which is more difficult to treat, but it is not terrible. As long as the patient can ensure confidence in the treatment and actively cooperate with the doctor's treatment, the cure can be achieved.

It is reminded that the diet should maintain a balanced nutrition, with a light diet, not a partial eclipse, let alone overeating. In addition, we must maintain an optimistic mood, do not be overly nervous, and participate in physical exercises appropriately, which can play a certain role in preventing the recurrence of cancer.</p>

      <h3>Both mother and daughter were suffering from cancer and died after 3 months. Doctor: How can these 3 things be put in the porridge?</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Both mother and daughter were suffering from cancer and died after 3 months. Doctor: How can these 3 things be put in the porridge?

In recent years, the number of people suffering from cancer has been increasing year by year. According to surveys, our country has 3.07 million new cancer patients every year, which has seriously endangered our health.

There is a good saying, it is called "disease comes from the mouth." Cancer is a disease that can be caught at once. It is absolutely inseparable from the food we eat every day. Academician Sun Yan once said: "For There is no trick to fighting cancer. As long as you keep your mouth shut, don't eat foods that harm your body and cause cancer, and prevent the intrusion of toxins from the root, the disease will naturally disappear."



Ms. Li loves to drink peanut porridge. Her mother knows that Ms. Li loves peanut porridge, so she often buys some peanuts to keep at home. Usually the mother and daughter drink peanut porridge every day. Around August, Ms. Li always felt a little pain in her stomach, but she didn't take it seriously if she only occasionally hurts. About ten days later, Ms. Li's condition did not improve. Her mother also started to have stomach pains.



This incident made Ms. Li feel very abnormal, so Ms. Li went to the hospital for inspection. After a series of physical examinations, the doctor gave a diagnosis of liver cancer, and both mother and daughter had advanced liver cancer. The mother and daughter cried in each other's arms, but it was too late.



After communicating with the doctor in detail, the doctor said: It may be the peanuts in the peanut porridge you drink every day. You may not know that there are many things that cannot be put in the porridge.

The doctor said: These 3 kinds of foods damage the body, eat them every day, they may feed cancer cells

1. Peanuts with folds and yellowish color

After peanuts become moldy and bitter, I believe that everyone will not eat them again, but you may overlook one point, that is, peanuts that have become wrinkled and yellow in color, because when peanuts become like this, most of them are already Has gone bad.



After peanuts become moldy and bitter, I believe that everyone will not eat them again, but you may overlook one point, that is, peanuts that have become wrinkled and yellow in color, because when peanuts become like this, most of them are already Has gone bad.

A lot of carcinogens will grow in the peanuts that are wrinkled and yellow, including aflatoxin. Studies have found that only 20UG of aflatoxin can be fatal, and long-term intake of aflatoxin It can cause cancer in liver cells and affect health.

Aflatoxin is widely present in our daily life. In addition to peanuts that are wrinkled and yellowed, they cannot be eaten. Moldy foods and long-term soaked fungi will also produce a large amount of aflatoxin. These foods are all It cannot be eaten.

2. Speckled sweet potatoes

After the sweet potato is placed for a long time, black spots will appear on the surface of the sweet potato. This phenomenon occurs mostly because the red is contaminated by the black spot pathogen. Frequent eating of this kind of sweet potato with black spots will cause poisoning, serious It can also cause cancer and endanger life.



3. Sprouted potatoes

Most of us buy a lot of potatoes when they buy potatoes, because potatoes are not like green vegetables, which can be stored for a long time, but everyone must remember that moldy potatoes are not edible, and the same is true for sprouted potatoes. According to research, potatoes will produce a large amount of solanine after germination, too much consumption will cause poisoning, long-term consumption will cause edema in liver and other organs, which will affect health.



To maintain the liver, you must drink plenty of water. Sufficient supplementation of water can promote liver detoxification and increase the body's metabolic capacity. Usually, you should exercise more, don't stay up late, and develop good work and rest habits is the best protection for the liver.</p>

      <h3>Be careful! These 6 types of cancer have "family aggregation"!</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Be careful! These 6 types of cancer have "family aggregation"!

1. Breast cancer: the risk of daughters is 2~3 times higher

According to Chen Xiuchun, chief physician of the Department of Breast Cancer, Henan Cancer Hospital, the study found that 20% to 25% of breast cancer patients have family clusters, of which 55% to 60% belong to hereditary breast cancer, which accounts for 5% of the total breast cancer. ~10%.

Breast cancer has a genetic predisposition. Generally speaking, mothers get breast cancer and their daughters are 2 to 3 times more likely to get breast cancer than other women. It is clinically recommended that high-risk groups should conduct regular self-examinations and go to the hospital for physical examination once a year to achieve early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment.

At the same time, pay attention to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, healthy eating, reasonable sleep, etc., which can reduce the risk of disease. ②

2. Bowel cancer: 20%~30% of bowel cancer patients have family history

According to Deng Wenying, chief physician of the Department of Oncology, Henan Cancer Hospital, 20% to 30% of colorectal cancer patients have a family history of various cancers. If an elderly person in the family suffers from bowel cancer, it does not mean that the child will also get cancer, but in the same living environment, it is more likely to develop cancer than other people.

Relatives of patients with bowel cancer should undergo colonoscopy as soon as possible, so that colorectal cancer can be detected and treated as soon as possible. If there are patients with colorectal cancer in the family, their immediate family members should pay attention to whether they have changes in bowel habits and bowel traits, whether they have constipation, increased stool frequency, pus and blood in the stool, and abdominal pain, bloating, or intestinal obstruction. If the above symptoms occur, go to the hospital for fecal occult blood test, digital rectal examination, and colonoscopy. ②

3. Ovarian cancer: heredity is mostly caused by genetic mutations

Wu Xiaohua, director of the Department of Oncology and Gynecology of Fudan University Cancer Hospital, said that the main feature of this type of ovarian cancer is family clustering, and the "true culprit" that causes hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome is the BRCA1/2 gene mutation.

These two genes BRCA1/2 are important genes that "inhibit" cell canceration. Once a mutation occurs, the valve of "inhibition" canceration is opened, which leads to a higher risk of canceration.

Studies have shown that over 90% of hereditary ovarian cancers are caused by BRCA1/2 gene mutations. For women with a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, it is recommended to use genetic testing or effective genetic counseling to confirm that people with BRCA1/2 gene mutations can undergo preventive resection after evaluation by a professional doctor to avoid ovarian cancer or breast cancer. risk.

In addition, there are already many drugs targeting BRCA1/2 gene targets on the market. Identifying gene mutations can significantly help to obtain cutting-edge treatment options. ②

4. Gastric cancer: an obvious family gathering phenomenon

According to Chen Suqiong, chief physician of the Department of Oncology, Yinchuan First People's Hospital, gastric cancer is not a genetic disease. However, if a person has a family history, the incidence is relatively higher than that of no family history.

Gastric cancer has obvious family clustering phenomenon, there are two main reasons:

The first is genetic susceptibility. It is possible that there are common living habits and genetic inheritance in the family, so there may be susceptibility, but it does not mean that it must be a genetic disease.

In addition, a large number of clinical data prove that the offspring of patients with gastric cancer in the family do not necessarily have gastric cancer. However, dietary habits and the increase of certain carcinogens in the environment that everyone is exposed to can indeed increase the body's susceptibility to cancer.

For familial gastric cancer, it is recommended to do regular screening and advance prevention. If symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, stomach swelling, and unexplained weight loss often occur, you should also go to the hospital for diagnosis as soon as possible. ②

5. Liver cancer: children are targeted for primary prevention

According to Wang Qian, deputy chief physician of the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery of Henan Cancer Hospital, if parents are diagnosed with liver cancer, their children are the primary prevention targets. Because of the vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus, it is easy to cause the tendency of family gathering of liver cancer. Especially mothers with hepatitis B virus have a higher chance of liver cancer in their offspring.

Liver cancer is mainly related to infection. For example, if one person in a family has hepatitis B or C, other family members are easily infected. The high-risk group of liver cancer is patients with chronic viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis caused by various reasons. However, as long as the patients with hepatitis are controlled in time, actively treat the hepatitis and block its development process, which will help to avoid the occurrence of liver cancer.

If you have hepatitis patients in your home, you should be vaccinated regularly. At the same time, it is recommended to adopt a split meal system to avoid cross-use of tableware at home and reduce hepatitis infection. There is a liver cancer patient in the family, and their children must undergo a comprehensive liver examination, such as liver function, B-ultrasound, etc., regardless of their health. ②

6. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: there is an obvious family genetic predisposition

Deng Qinghua, director of the Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy of Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, said that several people in the same family have suffered from nasopharyngeal cancer at the same time. Analysis of the cause, genetics is the basis and a factor that cannot be ignored. Studies have found that people with a family history of nasopharyngeal cancer are 20-40 times more likely to develop the disease than normal people.

One of the items in the routine physical examination is to check the nose. Many people think it’s okay not to do it. In fact, this can be screened for nasopharyngeal cancer. If the location of the nasopharyngeal tumor is not particularly hidden, an experienced ENT doctor can basically see the lesion during the examination. The current clinical EB virus detection is also an important auxiliary diagnostic method for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. If anyone in the family has ever had nasopharyngeal cancer, I suggest you go to the hospital for a nasoscopy and Epstein-Barr virus test.</p>

      <h3>Chinese medicine injections participate in the fight against the new coronavirus</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Chinese medicine injections participate in the fight against the new coronavirus


"In order to convince people with traditional Chinese medicine injections, you must use data and evidence to speak, and you must also form a chain of evidence. One piece of evidence is too lonely, and several pieces of evidence around a clinical issue form an evidence group, which is invincible. Land.” Talking about the related issues of Chinese medicine injections, Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, expressed this view in an interview with the "China Science News".

As a member of the expert group of the Central Steering Group for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Zhang Boli spent 82 days in Wuhan. He believes that in the treatment of the new crown pneumonia, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine is the highlight of the Chinese plan. Moreover, Jiangxia Fangcang, the only traditional Chinese medicine shelter hospital, mainly uses integrated Chinese medicine treatment. In the end, none of the patients became severely ill, and the medical staff also had zero infections.

On March 23, at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council in Wuhan, Zhang Boli recommended the "three medicines and three prescriptions", namely Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Huashi Baidu Recipe, Xuanfei Baidu Recipe, Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lian Huaqingwen Capsule, Xuebijing Injection (hereinafter referred to as Xuebijing). Among them, Xuebijing was selected as the only Chinese medicine injection.

"This means that the efficacy and safety of Xuebijing have been jointly recognized by the Central Guiding Expert Group of Chinese and Western medicine experts, and have been confirmed at the national level." said Qiu Haibo, deputy dean of Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University.

On April 12, the National Medical Products Administration approved Xuebijing's new indications "can be used for severe and critical systemic inflammatory response syndrome or/and multiple organ failure with new coronavirus pneumonia."

"Xuebijing is mainly a prescription for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Initially, it appears to be effective against new coronary pneumonia and reduces the fatality rate. However, some evidence-based medical evidence is still needed." In the live interview of "Nanshan Breath", Zhong Nanshan, leader of the high-level expert group of the National Health Commission and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said when answering questions about the new crown pneumonia epidemic.

Initiate new evidence-based research

Time is pulled back to the early stage of the outbreak of new coronary pneumonia. How to scientifically prevent and treat patients with severe new coronary pneumonia has become the most urgent problem.

As a new coronavirus, scientists still don't know much about it. The members of the expert group can only select those drugs that may be effective against new coronary pneumonia. This includes not only the antiviral therapy drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, the glucocorticoid drug methylprednisolone, etc., but also the traditional Chinese medicine injection Xuebijing and Xiyanping.

"Most patients with severe pneumonia have sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. There is no evidence that existing chemical or biological drugs can reduce the mortality of these patients and improve the prognosis." Professor of Respiratory Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University Song Yuanlin told the Chinese Journal of Science that there were few reports on clinical trials of drugs for the treatment of severe pneumonia in adults after searching international literature in the past 20 years. This is because the condition of critically ill patients is very complicated and it is difficult to carry out research according to fixed conditions.

It is worth mentioning that in September last year, under the guidance of Zhong Nanshan and Zhang Boli, the Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and 33 tertiary hospitals completed the "Xuebijing in the treatment of severe pneumonia randomized controlled trial" after ten years. Related papers were published in the American Journal of Critical Care Medicine. The results of the study show that Xuebijing can significantly reduce the mortality of patients with severe pneumonia, increase the rate of improvement of pneumonia index risk rating, and shorten the time of mechanical ventilation and ICU treatment.

It is also based on the evidence-based medical evidence that Xuebijing reduces the 28-day mortality rate of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia combined with sepsis. On January 21, Zhong Nanshan served as the research project leader and initiated the “Xuebijing injection treatment” Clinical and mechanism research on the curative effect of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus infection" to evaluate the effects of Xuebijing on acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood coagulation dysfunction, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and other serious life-threatening patients with new coronary pneumonia. The blocking and improving effect of complications.

Clinical effect recognized by experts

The preliminary results of the study show that Xuebijing can significantly inhibit the excessive release of inflammatory factors or "inflammatory storms" induced by the new coronavirus. On the basis of conventional treatment, United Xuebijing has an effective rate of 91% in the treatment of severe patients with new coronary pneumonia.

This conclusion has also been recognized by many respiratory and critical medicine experts.

At a press conference held by the State Council Information Office in Wuhan, Qiu Haibo said that traditional Chinese medicine has already seen curative effects in the process of transforming ordinary and severe forms. It has played a certain role in the treatment of severe cases and is also very important in rehabilitation. effect.

"From the perspective of Western medicine, most chemical drugs are single-targeted, while Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine are more multi-targeted. In other words, Chinese medicine is more like a team fighting. This treatment mode is different from Chinese and Western medicine. Qiu Haibo took Xuebijing as an example, and pointed out that it has at least 6 active ingredients that have been proven, and it has the advantages of comprehensive treatment of complex diseases with traditional Chinese medicine "multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway". Related in vitro experiments also proved that Xuebijing has an inhibitory effect on the replication of the new coronavirus. In related animal experiments, Xuebijing has a curative effect on inflammation and coagulopathy.

Talking about the principle of Xuebijing's containment of inflammatory storms and coagulation dysfunction, Li Zhijun, chairman of the China Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Emergency Medicine Committee, said in an interview with the media that once the "inflammatory storm" and the "coagulation storm" form a vicious interaction, it is A sign of worsening illness, if it worsens, the patient may experience shock and organ failure, and the mortality rate will increase significantly. If Xuebijing is used in the early stage of the disease, it can not only protect the vascular endothelial cells damaged by systemic inflammatory response syndrome, reduce capillary leakage, but also reduce the formation of capillary microthrombosis, thereby reducing the incidence of coagulopathy and cutting off the condition The progression from toxic fever to blood stasis.

Talking about the safety of traditional Chinese medicine injections, Qiu Haibo said that the side effects of Xuebijing are not higher than 1% of clinical use, "so it is basically safe."

Still need further evidence-based medical evidence

The reporter noticed that several versions of the "New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Plan" and the "New Coronavirus Pneumonia Severe and Critical Case Diagnosis and Treatment Plan" promulgated by the National Health Commission all have special Chinese medicine treatment plans, including Chinese medicine decoctions, Chinese patent medicine, Chinese medicine injection, etc. Among them, Xuebijing is the only recommended drug written in two treatment programs of Western medicine and Chinese medicine, and is promoted to the world as the "three drugs and three prescriptions" of the "Chinese program".

It is understood that Xuebijing is an intravenous preparation selected by Professor Wang Jinda of Tianjin First Central Hospital based on the ancient prescription Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction. It has been successfully developed after 30 years. It is composed of safflower, red peony, chuanxiong, salvia and angelica. It has the functions of promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, cooling blood and nourishing blood, and dispersing toxins. It is indicated for the treatment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome induced by infection. Because of its clear efficacy in treating SARS patients, Xuebijing entered the green channel for rapid approval of new anti-SARS drugs and was approved for marketing in early 2004. It is currently the exclusive product of Hongri Pharmaceutical.

During the interview, Yao Xiaoqing, the founder and chairman of Hongri Pharmaceuticals, told the China Science Daily that after Xuebijing was listed, in order to further verify its effectiveness and safety, and provide guidance for clinical applications, they focused on Xuebijing The material basis, pharmacological effects, clinical efficacy and safety of the company have carried out a series of evidence-based medicine research for more than ten years.

Up to now, China has carried out "Randomized Controlled Trials of Xuebijing in the Treatment of Severe Pneumonia", "Randomized Controlled Trials of Xuebijing in the Treatment of Sepsis" and "Randomized Controlled Trials of Xuebijing in the Treatment of Severe Sepsis with DIC" "Randomized Controlled Trial of Xuebijing's Efficacy in Treating AECOPD" and "Clinical Safety Centralized Monitoring Study of Xuebijing after Marketing".

"But the new crown pneumonia epidemic is a very large public health event. At present, Xuebijing is mainly applied to patients with very severe inflammation, so the final clinical research results need further analysis." Qiu Haibo said.

In addition, Zhong Nanshan emphasized that whether TCM and Western medicine are effective cannot be based on impressions, but must be proved by modern evidence-based medicine. Effectiveness must be promoted. New coronary pneumonia is a new problem, and there must be evidence to see if it is effective. Only by obtaining solid data and confirming that the treatment is effective can it be better promoted at home and abroad.</p>

      <h3>The total effective rate of Chinese medicine in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia is more than 90%</h3>
      <p contenteditable>“Of the confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the country, 74,187 people have used Chinese medicine, accounting for 91.5%, of which 61,449 people in Hubei Province have used Chinese medicine, accounting for 90.6%. Observations of clinical efficacy show that the total effective rate of Chinese medicine has reached 90%. Above. Traditional Chinese medicine can effectively relieve symptoms, reduce the development of mild and common types to severe, increase the cure rate, reduce the mortality rate, and promote the recovery of people in the recovery period. All walks of life believe that Chinese medicine has played an important role and became this epidemic. A highlight of prevention and control." On the afternoon of March 23, the State Council Information Office held a press conference in Wuhan, Hubei Province, said Yu Yanhong, a member of the Central Steering Group, a member of the Party Group of the National Health Commission, and Secretary of the Party Group of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Zhang Boli, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, also said at the meeting, “Practice has proved that early intervention and full participation of traditional Chinese medicine have played an important role in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia." If the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic is regarded as a parabola, Traditional Chinese medicine will work better at both ends. "At present, although we do not have specific medicines, Chinese medicine has already come up with an effective plan. In particular, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine is a bright spot in China's fight against new coronary pneumonia."

According to the analysis of the World Health Organization, nearly 13% of patients with new coronary pneumonia will become severely ill, and 7% of patients may become critically ill. However, in Jiangxia Fangcai Hospital, which was taken over by the "national team" of Chinese medicine, as of March 10, it was officially "closed" and "none of the 564 patients became severe."

According to Yu Yanhong, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has carried out simultaneous observations on the clinical efficacy of proprietary Chinese medicines and prescriptions that have been included in the fifth, sixth, and seventh editions of the diagnosis and treatment plan, and screened out the "three-drug three-prescriptions" that have obvious effects on the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. ": Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Xuebijing Injection, as well as Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Dampness Dispelling Decoction, Xuanfei Baidu Decoction.

"Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have obvious differences in treatment modes. Most chemical drugs in Western medicine are single-target treatments, while Chinese medicine is more multi-target treatment. Chinese medicine is more like'a team in combat'. "Said Qiu Haibo, vice president of Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University, "Chemical drugs are often targeted at a certain target, while Chinese medicine may be a multi-target therapy." A study of 156 patients involving 32 hospitals showed that basic treatment was added. After Shangxue Bijing injection, the effective rate is relatively high.

Liu Qingquan, president of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia, many traditional Chinese medicine "old medicines and new applications" have achieved good results. Jinhua Qinggan Granules and Lianhua Qingwen Capsules are good examples.

"Jinhua Qinggan Granules is a new medicine developed for H1N1 influenza in 2009. It is composed of Maxing Shigan Decoction and Yinqiao Powder." Zhang Boli said.

During the epidemic, the expert team conducted a clinical controlled study on 102 patients. The results showed that compared with ordinary patients, the proportion of patients taking Jinhua Qinggan Granules decreased by 2/3, and the fever reduction time was shortened by 1.5 days. The time for the test to turn negative was reduced by 2.5 days.

Zhang Boli introduced that Lianhua Qingwen Capsule was a prescription developed during SARS. During the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, clinical research results showed that the disappearance rate of main clinical symptoms and the duration of clinical symptoms in patients taking Lianhua Qingwen Capsules were better than those of the control group, and the improvement rate of lung imaging reached 83.8%. The clinical cure rate reached 78.9%.

In addition, the "three prescriptions" in the "three medicines and three prescriptions" is also a model of "old medicine renovation".

Huang Luqi, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and dean of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, said that the Qingfei Paidu Decoction is derived from Maxing Shigan Decoction, Shegan Mahuang Decoction, Xiao Chaihu Decoction, Wuling Powder, etc. Clinical observations of 57 critically ill patients treated with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine and taking Qingfei Paidu Decoction showed that 42 patients were cured and discharged, accounting for 73.7%, and none of them became critically ill. The lung imaging comparison of the patients showed that after taking Qingfei Paidu Decoction for two courses (6 days), the lung lesions of 53 patients showed different degrees of reduction and absorption.

Xuanfei Baidu Recipe is condensed on the basis of classic recipes such as Maxing Shigan Decoction and Maxing Yigan Decoction. The Xuanfeibaidu group (70 cases) and the control group (50 cases) conducted in Wuhan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine and other units showed that Xuanfeibaidu Decoction is effective in controlling inflammation and increasing lymphocyte counts. It has significant curative effect. Compared with the control group, the recovery of lymphocytes is increased by 17%, and the clinical cure rate can be increased by 22%.

Huashibaidu Recipe is optimized by the medical team of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Jinyintan Hospital on the basis of the prescriptions recommended by the national diagnosis and treatment plan. The clinical controlled trial of Jinyintan Hospital enrolled 75 critically ill patients. The pulmonary inflammation and clinical symptoms diagnosed by CT were significantly improved, and the time for nucleic acid conversion and hospitalization were shortened by an average of 3 days.

Yu Yanhong, secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that at present, my country has shared its experience in Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment with Japan, South Korea, the United States, Italy and other countries. It has sent Chinese medicine experts to Italy, Cambodia and other countries and provided a variety of Chinese medicines. China is willing to carry out international cooperation on Chinese medicine to participate in epidemic prevention and control with countries in need, and provide assistance within its capacity.</p>

      <h3>New crown vaccine research and development, why China leads the world</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Recently, China's first new crown vaccine was approved for conditional listing. According to the press conference of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, from the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine approved for Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, to the world’s first phase III clinical trials, to the first conditional release of the vaccine, my country The research and development of the new crown vaccine has always been in the world's first square.

Why can China's new crown vaccine research and development lead the world? Behind this is not only the efforts of scientific researchers, but also the guarantee of institutional mechanisms. What enlightenment can the research and development experience of the new crown vaccine bring to my country's health development and technological innovation? It is worth thinking about.

As a drug policy researcher, the author was asked this question when communicating with foreign scholars recently: China's vaccine innovation and regulatory capabilities are not stronger than those of some developed countries, why is it firmly ranked in the research and development of new crown vaccines? The world's first echelon? It can be heard that foreign scholars have goodwill towards China's new crown vaccine, but there are also doubts. The author answered with a smile at that time, this is a good question, worthy of our thinking. The answer to this question may also provide enlightenment for other scientific and technological problems in our country.

1. The Chinese people must have their own vaccine in their syringes, and my country's new crown vaccine research and development has always been at the forefront of the world

Vaccines are the "stop button" of the pandemic. The strategic goal of my country's fight against the new crown pneumonia epidemic is to keep local transmission from occurring or maintain the transmission at a low level until a safe and effective vaccine is developed and widely vaccinated to form a population immune barrier.

According to data released on the World Health Organization website, as of December 29, 2020, there are a total of 232 new crown vaccines in the world in active research and development, and 60 of them are in clinical trials. Of the 15 vaccines in Phase III clinical trials, China has 5 vaccines. Whether it is the first to announce the evaluation results of the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines in non-human primate models in the world, or the official release of the world’s first human clinical trial data of the new crown vaccine, or the number of candidate vaccines that have entered phase III clinical trials, China Always at the forefront of the world, progress is encouraging.

China is also one of the few countries in the world that can rely on its own strength to solve all immunization programs and vaccines. The annual production capacity of vaccines exceeds 1 billion doses. It passed the evaluation of the World Health Organization's National Vaccine Regulatory System (NRA) twice in 2011 and 2014 . It can be said that the Chinese have their own vaccine in their syringes.

Of course, while seeing the results, we must admit that there is still much room for improvement in the innovation and regulatory effectiveness of the vaccine industry. It is understood that currently only 4 vaccine products in the country have obtained World Health Organization pre-qualification (PQ), compared with 10 in South Korea and 51 in India. The many vaccine incidents that have occurred in recent years have brought public health safety risks, and achievements and challenges coexist.

Focusing on the current status of the vaccine system, we need to think about the formation path of the new crown vaccine research and development capabilities, and tell the "Chinese story" of the new crown vaccine research and development: a new national system under multiple conditions such as market economy, emergencies, and globalization. How does China demonstrate its institutional advantages?

2. Taking people's health as the center has become a social consensus, and the scientific research "race" mechanism guides the close linkage of the vaccine research and development industry chain

The pandemic of infectious diseases is a typical phenomenon of risk society. The response to infectious diseases involves multiple subjects, and knowledge, resources, and information are highly dispersed. Since unilateral government administration cannot solve all practical problems, it is necessary to stimulate the endogenous power of the market and society through collaborative governance. Based on this theoretical framework, we analyze the new crown vaccine development process from two aspects: motivation and action.

On the one hand, it is motivation, that is, adhere to the strategic goal of focusing on people's health. Public health emergencies have amplified the uncertainty of vaccine research and development, and market mechanisms are prone to failure. Therefore, in the early stage of the epidemic, many multinational pharmaceutical companies did not invest in vaccine research and development on a large scale due to commercial considerations. They are either worried about the failure of research and development, or have a fluke for the survival of the epidemic.

The situation in China is different. Based on a deep understanding of the strategic value of the new crown vaccine, the state requires scientific research units to "not count economic income accounts, only people's health accounts" and provide special fund guarantees. my country's requirements for establishing a national vaccine reserve system and China's new crown vaccine's commitment to be a global public product provide companies with a broad market space. This credible commitment strengthens positive incentives and expectations, thereby effectively correcting market failures and accelerating the vaccine development process. The bottom line of the country’s thinking and strategic determination lies in persisting in vaccine research and development even if it is prepared but not used, even if the virus disappears, even if it is invested in the flood. Facts have proved that from the launch of the first batch of emergency research projects by the Ministry of Science and Technology in January 2020, to the third phase of overseas clinical trials conducted by many Chinese-funded companies in July, and the release of relevant data in December, the "China speed" of new crown vaccine development is not only It is much faster than the usual 5-18 years, and beyond the 12-18 months vaccine development cycle in a pandemic scenario.

On the other hand, actions under this consensus, that is, all parties involved in vaccine research and development help each other and are interdependent. Vaccine research and development involves multiple departments, and the “fragmentation” pattern is mainly manifested in two aspects: policy coordination and resource sharing. It is not easy to build an institutional system that encourages research and development. For example, scientists hope to innovate a vaccine with a broad-spectrum immune response, but this also means more abnormal reactions, so the regulatory authorities believe that its safety is unacceptable. Another example is that vaccine research and development resources are scattered in the academy of sciences, the Ministry of Science and Technology, institutions of higher learning, military units, central enterprises, and medical institutions. In the past, they lacked effective cooperation. In order to organize and mobilize the nation's superior forces to achieve specific scientific and technological innovation goals in a state of emergency, the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism Scientific Research Team established a special vaccine class in February 2020. The special class is composed of the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Health Commission, the Drug Administration and other departments, and it is responsible for coordinating inter-departmental goals and making efforts in the same direction. It has powerfully brought together all the superior forces and elements of medical institutions, scientific research institutions, enterprises and regulatory agencies to realize the linkage of "medical research and production" work such as virus strain isolation, animal testing, product preparation, and clinical research, thereby respecting scientific laws. Promote vaccine research and development under the premise.

Coordinated actions are also reflected in the relationship between the government and the market. The new crown vaccine is a brand-new thing that needs to mobilize the autonomy and endogenous motivation of scientific research units, and invest in research and development and accumulate knowledge for a long time. The ability to deal with major crises is forced out of crises after crises. Since the SARS incident in 2003, scientific research units have used the policy windows of avian influenza, pandemic influenza, Ebola and other new outbreaks of infectious diseases to make full use of the country’s supportive institutions and mechanisms to continue to enlarge the accumulation of useful knowledge. Major breakthroughs have been made in platforms and other aspects. In the research and development of the new crown vaccine, the government has effectively embedded the industry-university-research network to dynamically grasp cutting-edge information. At the beginning of the epidemic, it has focused on supporting 5 technical routes and 12 vaccine research and development tasks simultaneously. The vaccine class introduces the "race" mechanism for scientific research. This method of accurately identifying and supporting "masters" and respecting the economic interests of R&D subjects guides the close linkage between the upstream and downstream of the vaccine R&D industry chain to jointly race against the virus. As a result, in large countries that are accustomed to concentrating their efforts on major issues, companies have become the real mainstay of new crown vaccine research and development.

3. A new national system that respects the market and raises R&D efficiency instead of focusing on major tasks in the traditional sense

In summary, the new nationwide system is embodied in the research and development of the new crown vaccine. It takes national public health safety and people's health as the policy goals, scientifically coordinate, concentrate forces, optimize systems, coordinate research, and focus on the strategic commanding heights of epidemic prevention and control to achieve high quality Institutional arrangements for development and efficient governance. Among them, the centralized and unified leadership of the party cracked the market failure and "fragmentation" policy system. The strategic decision of "calculating people's health accounts, not economic accounts" provides credible promises and consistent goals for scientific research units to invest in research and development on a large scale. The institutionalized guarantee represented by the special class of vaccine research and development has not only achieved a high degree of coordination between the drug regulatory department and the science and technology department, but also changed the cost-benefit balance of each subject, shaping medical institutions, scientific research institutions, regulatory agencies, enterprises, and military entities. Coordinate actions to maximize R&D efficiency. Good synergy results are positively fed back to the above goals and structure, further strengthening the implementation of coordinated actions, thus forming a virtuous circle.

The success of China's new crown vaccine research and development is not accidental. It is derived from the long-term accumulation of research and development capabilities, including related improvements in drug inspection and review and other regulatory capabilities, as well as the government's policy network embedded in the industry to identify "masters". This is neither the result of pure market evolution nor the traditional concentration of forces to do major events. It depends on the interaction of two factors: one is the recognition of market mechanisms and corporate interests, and the other is that the country gives full play to its institutional advantages to carry out political mobilization. This is a new nationwide system based on respect for the market. In other words, knowledge accumulation and policy support are only static results, and the new crown vaccine research and development benefit from the collaborative system and its operation. The above content expounds the theoretical logic of China's new crown vaccine research and development, and effectively responds to the one-sided understanding of some people in the West.

The research and development of the new crown vaccine demonstrates the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. It is not designed, but is the result of the practice of mutual respect, mutual desire, and repeated interaction between the government and enterprises under the centralized and unified leadership of the party. This kind of system with consistent policy goals, strong political mobilization, and clear subject boundaries is what we call "national coordination" in theory. In this sense, the accumulation of research and development capabilities and policy windows are only process variables for the high-efficiency research and development of the new crown vaccine. The resilience and flexibility of the nationwide collaboration are the deep-level institutional factors that have spawned this success, which is important for strengthening national strategies. The power of science and technology has more universal and far-reaching significance.

Protection rate reaches 79.34%

A few days ago, the State Council announced at the press conference of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism that the Sinopharm China Bio-New Crown Inactivated Vaccine has been approved by the State Drug Administration for conditional listing. Existing data show that the protection rate is 79.34%, achieving the unity of safety, effectiveness, accessibility, and affordability, and meeting the relevant standards of the World Health Organization and the National Food and Drug Administration. In the future, the durability and protective effect of vaccine immunity need to be continuously observed. Xu Nanping, Vice Minister of Science and Technology, said that so far, 14 vaccines from 5 technical routes in my country have entered clinical trials, of which 5 vaccines from 3 technical routes have entered phase III clinical trials.

More than 3 million inoculated

Zeng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commission and head of the vaccine research team of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, said that the vaccination of key populations in my country was officially launched on December 15. In the past two months, the cumulative vaccination of key populations across the country has exceeded 3 million doses. In the vaccination work, a series of systems have been established such as complete vaccination site setting specifications, strict training of vaccination personnel, screening of the recipients, monitoring of adverse reactions, emergency treatment and expert consultation for serious adverse reactions to ensure the vaccination work Safe and smooth. Zeng Yixin said: "This time 3 million, plus the previous 1.5 million, fully prove that the vaccine is safe."</p>

      <h3>These traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions are effective in treating new coronary pneumonia, and the "three medicines and three prescriptions" write a Chinese medicine anti-epidemic plan</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Traditional Chinese medicine (Traditional Chinese medicines) played a very good role in the control and treatment of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic. After screening studies, Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lianhua Qingwen Capsules/ Granules, Xuebijing Injection, Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Huashi Baidu Decoction, Xuanfei Baidu Decoction, these "three medicines and three prescriptions" proved effective.




　　What are the specific effects of these prescriptions? Who is suitable for? Let us introduce them one by one.

　　 Jinhua Qinggan Granules


Jinhua Qinggan Granules is a Chinese patent medicine developed during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It consists of 12 herbs including honeysuckle, peppermint, and licorice. Its main functions are to relieve wind and lungs, clear away heat and detoxify, and can treat mild and common types. It has a definite curative effect in patients, which can shorten the time of antipyretic, increase the normalization rate of lymphocytes and white blood cells, and significantly reduce the rate of severe disease.

　　Jinhua Qinggan Granule was developed during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It consists of 12 herbal components including honeysuckle, mint and licorice and can clear heat and detoxify lungs.

　　It has a curative effect in treating mild and moderate patients and can also improve the recovery rate of lymphocyte and white blood cells as well as reduce the rate of patients turning more severe.



　　 Zhang Boli, member of the expert group of the Central Steering Group, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and president of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, introduced that the two projects that have been carried out have found that Jinhua Qinggan has a good effect. In early February, after treatment of 102 patients with mild and common new coronary pneumonia in Wuhan, it was found that the patient's rate of turning serious was significantly reduced, only 11.8%. The patient's fever time is only 1.5 days.

　　 In early February, 102 mild patients in Wuhan took Jinhua Qinggan Granule in their treatment. Only 11.8 percent worsened and it took only one and a half days for patients to reduce fever.

An 80-case controlled study conducted by Professor Li Xuexiu from the Fourth Medical Center of the General Hospital of the People’s Liberation Army in Beijing You’an Hospital also found that patients who were given Jinhua Qinggan had nucleic acid turned negative two and a half days earlier than the control group, and lung inflammation improved. The average time is 8 days, while the control group is 10.3 days.

A comparative experiment showed that patients who took Jinhua Qinggan Granule tested negative for coronavirus two and a half days earlier than a group that did not take the granule. The group treated with the granule also took eight days to show improvement, while the other group took 10.3 days.

　　Lianhua Qingwen Capsules / Granules


Lianhua Qingwen Capsules/granules are composed of 13 medicines. They are commonly used Chinese patent medicines for the treatment of colds and flu. The main effects are to clear the wind, detoxify, and relieve heat from the lungs. It is effective in treating mild and common patients, especially fever and cough. , The fatigue disappears quickly, which can reduce the occurrence of mild and common type to severe, and promote the conversion of nucleic acid to negative.



Lianhua Qingwen medicine is a very common traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of cold and flu. Composed of 13 herbal components, it has shown curative effects on mild and common patients, especially in relieving fever, cough and fatigue. It can reduce the occurrence of deterioration and help patients test negative.

　　Xuebijing Injection

　　

　　 Xuebijing injection is a proprietary Chinese medicine developed and marketed during the SARS period in 2003. It is composed of 5 Chinese herbal extracts. Its main effect is to remove blood stasis and detoxification, and is used to treat sepsis.

　　 This injection was developed and marketed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. It consists of five herbal extracts and its main function is to detoxify and remove blood stasis. It is usually used to treat sepsis.



　　 In the treatment of severe and critical patients, it is suitable for systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by infection. It can also be used to treat multiple organs with impaired organ function. Preliminary clinical studies have shown that combined use with western medicine can increase the rate of cure and discharge and reduce the transition from severe to critical illness. Basic research has initially found that it has a certain in vitro antiviral effect and can significantly inhibit the inflammatory factors induced by the new coronavirus infection.

It is effective in suppressing systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by infection in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients as well as repairing impaired organ function.

Initial clinical studies have shown that the injection, combined with Western medicine, can increase the rate of hospital discharge and reduce the rate of deterioration. Basic research has also found that it has a certain antiviral effect in vitro that can significantly inhibit inflammatory factors induced by novel coronavirus infection.



In addition to treating inflammatory reactions and preventing cytokine storms, Xuebijing also has anti-thrombotic function, because this new coronary pneumonia will also cause excessive blood clotting, forming thrombus everywhere in the body, causing organ embolism and damage to tissues. Net can well protect endothelial cells, prevent excessive blood clotting in the body, and prevent the formation of microthrombi.

　　The novel coronavirus also tends to cause excessive clotting in the body that leads to organ embolism and damages tissues, and Xuebijing can help prevent excessive coagulation and the formation of thrombus.

　　 Previously, led by Professor Bai Chunxue from Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, a randomized controlled trial of Xuebijing was conducted in conjunction with 33 hospitals. Data analysis of 710 cases showed that Xuebijing combined with conventional treatment can reduce the 28-day mortality rate of patients with severe pneumonia by 8.8% and shorten the 4-day ICU stay.

　　A comparative experiment of 710 cases jointly conducted by over 30 hospitals showed that the injection combined with regular treatment can reduce the mortality rate of severe patients by 8.8 percent and shorten intensive care unit hospitalization by 4 days.

The Xuebijing project led by members of the Central Steering Group, Vice Dean of Zhongda Hospital of Southeast University, Qiu Haibo, Academician Zhong Nanshan, and Director Song Yuanling of Zhongshan Hospital, began clinical trials on severe and critically ill patients with new coronary pneumonia at the end of January application. At present, 156 patients in 32 hospitals have used Xuebijing. Good results have been achieved.

　　Another project saw Xuebijing Injection applied clinically to severe and critical patients from the end of January, with 156 patients in 32 hospitals treated. They all achieved very good improvements.

　　 According to Qiu Haibo, the clinical safety study of Xuebijing after its launch shows that the adverse reaction rate is about 0.3%, which is a very safe number and will not be rejected with other antibiotics and other therapeutics.

　　Research on the clinical safety of Xuebijing also showed that the adverse reaction rate was about 0.3 percent, which is a very safe figure, and it will not react adversely with other antibiotics or treatment.

      <h3>The way you have always thought of "enhancing" immunity is wrong</h3>
      <p contenteditable>

For people experiencing the cold season, your immune system may need some important support.
We asked Amelia Freer, an outstanding nutrition therapist and healthy diet expert, for some of the best suggestions for enhancing immunity. She answered us this way: "I really don't want to hear the term'enhanced' immunity." In fact, according to Freer The statement that we have been doing is wrong, we do not need to strengthen the immune system, but need to balance it.
Overactive immune system may cause autoimmune diseases or obvious large-scale allergies; and if the immune system is not active enough, or weakened resistance, it will increase our risk of infection-obviously, these two conditions are not ideal. Freer said: "In a nutshell, we hope to properly activate the autoimmune function and turn it off after the risk of infection."
As for how we can do this well, Freer recommends that we provide nourishment and support for overall physical and mental health. She said: "In order to improve or suppress the immune response at an appropriate level, our body needs a variety of nutrients. The best way is to ensure a balanced, nutritious and rich diet. Therefore, eating a variety of natural foods in winter can be regarded as A good start."
1. Take a lot of dark green vegetables
"First of all, dark green vegetables such as kale, beets, spinach, arugula, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli. They all contain a variety of beneficial phytonutrients, fiber, vitamin A, magnesium ions and folic acid. If you want to add something to our recipe, it should be this type of vegetable. Eat at least one dark green vegetable a day (remember, they will be much smaller after cooking, so you can reach your goal more easily )."
2. Choose citrus fruits
The way you have always thought of "enhancing" immunity is wrong
"Citrus fruits are an excellent source of vitamin C supplements[3]. They are very suitable for the severe winter-to provide us with a little concentrated sunlight when we need it most. I love the months when blood oranges are on the market (12 From October to April), as long as conditions permit, I have to eat one of the most delicious desserts every day."
3. Set aside your belly to eat mackerel
"This is a cheap and easy-to-buy oil-rich fish, and it is also one of the sources of Omega-3 long-chain fatty acids. Omega-3 long-chain fatty acids can help regulate inflammation in the body. Mackerel also contains vitamin D and Protein is a good choice for light lunches. Important advice: You can find unsmoked frozen mackerel fillets in the freezer section of some supermarkets. I found that mackerel is the most suitable for cooking with frozen fish fillets, and it is also richer than smoked fish fillets. Little salt."
4. Ingest some pumpkin
"In winter, we can enjoy many varieties of yellow pulp pumpkins. They provide fat-soluble vitamin A, which is best for absorption together with healthy fats. Therefore, I like to slowly roast pumpkins with a little olive oil and enjoy them: or Stir it in a thick soup, or add a salad with arugula, chicory, roasted hazelnuts and shredded feta cheese."
5. Use abalone fruit to balance your diet
"Abalone fruit is one of the main sources of micronutrient selenium, and selenium is one of the important minerals required for optimal immune response. Eating 4 to 5 abalone fruit per week can meet our selenium needs. However, selenium It is also one of the few natural food nutrients that we can overtake, so it is best to eat a little bit a week and mix it with other nuts."
6. Choose chickpeas or other beans
"I like legumes in all shapes and sizes. They are a convenient source of protein-my goal is to consume protein about the size of my palm with each meal. Protein is important for the body to maintain a proper immune response. Substances play an important role in the repair and growth of body tissues, maintaining appetite, and controlling blood sugar. I will buy beans in cans and add them to soup to make hummus or other sauces Ingredients, put a handful when making curry or stew, or just cook it with olive oil, lemon and crushed herbs, and then let it cool."
7. Switch to shellfish
"Shellfish are an excellent source of zinc and vitamin B12. Mussels and scallops are in the winter season. Shellfish are delicious and it is worth the trouble to cook them once in a while. Make sure that the source of shellfish is sustainable, if you don’t know. It’s also a good choice to order them when you’re out for a meal.”
8. Get in the habit of eating oats
"Oatmeal is a good choice. It not only allows you to have a steaming, delicious breakfast porridge, but also provides a lot of fiber. Soaking oats one night in advance can release the nutrients in the oats more fully and shorten your Cooking time."
9. Eat more eggs
"Eggs are a kind of practical and varied food material, which can be used as fast food and snacks. Eggs contain vitamin B12, a small amount of vitamin D, vitamin A, protein, and some also contain Omega-3 fatty acids. These are all maintenance An important substance to balance immune function."
10. Drink plenty of water
"Ensuring adequate water allows our mucosal barriers (such as oral mucosa and nasal mucosa) to remain moist. It may sound strange, but the water in tissues supports the innate immune function present in the tissues, before infection invades the body. , You can keep them out. In addition, drinking water will not destroy your appetite and will not affect your next meal of nutritious natural food."
11. Increase vitamin D
"In winter, the only dietary supplement that everyone needs to supplement is vitamin D. During the period from October to early March, some areas are not exposed to enough sunlight to allow our skin to synthesize enough vitamin D."
12. Optimize other lifestyles
"I know this is a cliché, but it's really effective: wash your hands frequently, ensure sleep, actively cope with and manage stress, move around regularly, exercise, drink alcohol in moderation, and don't smoke. This is not a new idea, but it is effective. ."</p>

      <h3>Eat Chinese medicine has caused liver damage for half a year?  </h3>
      <p contenteditable>Expert: Don't eat these 83 kinds of Chinese herbal medicine! Recently, a Fuyang girl fell into a coma due to liver failure and myocardial damage due to taking Xanthium water. Because the girl suffers from rhinitis, her mother believes that the traditional remedy uses Xanthium chinensis to boil water, but she does not know that the whole plant of Xanthium chinensis is poisonous, and it is the most poisonous. It cannot be used directly, and it eventually leads to misfortune. Many people believe that since common Chinese medicine can be used for diet therapy, even if it is not eaten well, it will not be bad. So many people will buy some Chinese medicines such as ginseng and astragalus, and make their own bubble tea and boil soup to regulate the body. In fact, no matter how common Chinese medicine is, you can't eat it yourself. For half a year of keeping in good health with traditional Chinese medicine, someone found liver injury, Haining People’s Hospital in Zhejiang Province, published a recent case on WeChat. A patient who loves keeping in good health, Mr. Zhou (pseudonym), recently found diffuse liver mass during physical examination. . The patient, Mr. Zhou, told the doctor that six months ago, he heard that Chinese herbal medicines such as "Sanqi and Cassia" have health effects on the body, so he bought some from the Internet and has been taking these Chinese herbal medicines. After comparing the results of MRI and other examinations, the doctor concluded that it was mainly the damage of the liver venules caused by the drugs, which looked like diffuse masses on imaging, and the most urgent thing was to stop taking those drugs. Picture source: Haining People's Hospital. In fact, there are not a few people like Mr. Zhou who rely on Chinese herbal medicine for health maintenance and conditioning. Many herbal medicines contain pyrrolidine alkaloids, which can cause hepatic venous occlusive disease and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. It is precisely because of this kind of so-called health maintenance that some patients with severe liver injury are even facing the situation of liver replacement. People generally have the notion that Chinese herbal medicines are harmless and natural plants are non-toxic. They do not realize that under this concept, self-prepared Chinese herbal medicines are harmful to the body. The 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia classifies 83 potentially toxic Chinese herbal medicines, of which 31 are low-toxic drugs, 42 are toxic drugs, and 10 are highly toxic drugs, totaling 83 types. Previously, Professor Nan Yuemin from the Department of Liver Diseases of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University also shared the "Classification of Chinese Herbal Hepatotoxicity" at the 2020 Academic Annual Meeting of the Society of Liver Diseases of the Chinese Medical Association. Source: In the medical field, among these 83 varieties, common ones in daily life include ginkgo, saponins, anemone, etc. Chinese herbal medicines have dual pharmacological and toxicological effects, and even their active ingredients are toxic ingredients, so not all Chinese herbal medicines They are all very safe. In life, these common Chinese herbal medicines are also minefields. In fact, in addition to the 83 types of hepatotoxic Chinese herbal medicines mentioned above, there are also some in daily life that seem to be "medicine and food homologous", but incorrect use will quietly poison your Chinese herbal medicine. Minefield": 1 Rose Ganoderma lucidum soaking in water should be moderate. Clinical studies have shown that Ganoderma lucidum spore powder is an effective ingredient of Ganoderma lucidum, but its outer shell is difficult to break, and the dissolution rate of direct soaking in water is very low. Roses and Ganoderma lucidum are warm in nature. People who are hot in summer or physique are not suitable for long-term drinking rose Ganoderma lucidum tea. Many people like to make tea with traditional Chinese medicine. Long-term blind drinking is bad for health. 2 Dendrobium health preservation In recent years, people have often promoted the health preservation effects of Dendrobium, but the health preservation of Dendrobium tea needs to be based on personal physique. Dendrobium has a cool nature, can nourish yin, and people who have yin deficiency and fire can try, such as those who are thin, have symptoms of getting angry, and have dry stool, and the premise is that they have no basis for other diseases. What needs to be reminded is that you should not "myth" the effects of Dendrobium, and you don't need to seek nobility blindly. For example, bitter melon mixed with cold dishes is also a good health dish. 3 Astragalus Do not drink Astragalus for a long time. Astragalus can reduce blood viscosity, reduce thrombosis, lower blood pressure, protect the heart, regulate blood sugar in both directions, and enhance immunity. It can be used to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and other diseases, but long-term drinking has an impact on the spleen and stomach. Astragalus is not suitable for people who have a full stomach with food, white and greasy tongue coating, and hyperactivity of yin and yang, otherwise it will aggravate the condition. 4 Ginkgo biloba soaking in water Drinking ginkgo biloba soaking in water is toxic. Ginkgo biloba products are the most commonly used natural medicine for the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the world, but it is dangerous to drink directly with fresh ginkgo biloba in water. The lactones and flavonoids in ginkgo biloba leaves are difficult to soak out with water. Among them, ginkgolic acid and ginkgol are very toxic, soluble in water, immunotoxic, cytotoxic, and harmful to human health. It is an important field of Chinese medicine to eat Chinese herbal medicine blindly, and be careful that the more you nourish it, the more you hurt your health. It has a long tradition in China. Rare medicinal materials such as ginseng are also endowed with magical effects such as immortality and revival. Many Chinese people think that Chinese herbal medicine can only make up, not hurt, so they like to add Chinese medicinal materials or soak in medicinal wine to their diet to strengthen their bones. In fact, apart from the hepatotoxicity of the medicine itself, the irregular and unreasonable combined application of Chinese herbal medicines not only fails to achieve the health preservation effect, but is harmful to the body. In daily life, there are many Chinese medicinal materials that enter the mouth not for curing diseases but for health preservation. As medicinal materials, they must have certain effects, but two very important aspects are ignored by most people: 1. On the one hand, Chinese herbal medicines are also included in the argument of "three points of poison" in medicine. On the other hand, how effective the effective ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines can be will vary from person to person and from disease to disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has its own extensive and profound dialectic system. It is not advisable to look at the properties of medicine alone without the dialectics. Chinese herbal medicines are also medicines. There are principles in the use of medicines. If you don’t listen to the doctor, you’ll just use your own feelings, or “see what others use well”. Taking medicine to maintain health is absolutely undesirable: "Stop the disease" is the most important thing, pay attention to the dosage, and can't take it for a long time without a reason. "Stop the disease" is for the use of drugs that are violent. When the disease is generally gone, It is about to stop using. The dosage of common Chinese herbal medicines should also be paid attention to. If the dosage is too large, side effects will also occur. For example, licorice Xingping can reconcile various medicines, but taking it for a long time without a reason can also affect the spleen and stomach qi and hinder digestion; if the dosage of rhubarb is too large or the time is too long, it can also cause adverse reactions such as loss of appetite, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Good prescriptions are not suitable for everyone, so it is necessary to divide the physique. Chinese medicine divides the physique into 9 types. Individuals vary greatly. Clinicians prescribe prescriptions that are symptomatic and prescribe medicine to people. In our lives, we must avoid saying what others say about health preservation. When we see other people's prescriptions are effective, we will try it, which may backfire. There are also examples of health care indiscriminately regardless of physique. For example, some people who have cold hands and feet, fearing the wind and rain, but still drink herbal tea health drinks. In the end, the body becomes colder and weaker. Others, who have too much stomach acid or chronic gastritis, have to drink health-preserving beverages such as sour plum soup every day. The acid is added to the acid to accelerate the corrosion of the gastric mucosa and destroy the gastrointestinal function. Elderly people should be careful with medication, especially those with underlying diseases. Many elderly people have some basic diseases, and blind tonic has a great impact on the body. Clinical trials have shown that taking more than 5 drugs at the same time will greatly increase the side effects or adverse reactions, and the liver and kidney function will decline after the age of 80. You should be more careful when eating Chinese herbal medicine. Reasonable application of Chinese herbal medicines can achieve corresponding curative effects. This is undeniable, but everyone should maintain a sufficiently clear understanding of the toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines, including liver toxicity. Chinese herbal medicines are also medicines. When you take medicine, you have to talk about science. The medicine is three-point poison. It is up to the doctor to take the medicine! The safest way to use Chinese herbal medicine is to go to a Chinese medicine hospital and let a professional Chinese medicine doctor take medicine for you and prescribe the right medicine for you. This is the healthy way to keep healthy. Another thing that needs to be reminded is that many people also have doubts. Since medicines are poisonous, how can they avoid drug-induced liver damage? In fact, many drugs have potential hepatotoxicity, so the liver is one of the organs that are more vulnerable to damage. Therefore, when taking hepatotoxic drugs, it is recommended to eat lecithin to help lower enzymes, regulate lipids, and repair liver cell damage, especially if the liver is not damaged. good person.</p>

      <h3>Cancer cells are osteogenic, and 4 abnormalities appear to remind you that bone metastasis has occurred</h3>
      <p contenteditable>

"This hasn't happened before. Since the last month, the weather is cold, easy to catch cold, love to sneeze, low back pain when sneezing, unable to straighten up."
Uncle Zhang is 68 years old this year, his body is still healthy, there is no major problem, because of the recent low back pain more and more frequent, he went to the hospital for examination, the result of the investigation is the late stage of renal cancer, really scary!
In this regard, the doctor explained with a CT report that the tumor in Uncle Zhang's body has undergone bone metastasis, and the bones in the lumbar spine have been hollowed out by nearly a quarter. Recently, frequent low back pain is a sign.
Cancer cells are prone to bone metastasis
Cancer cells have tenacious vitality. As long as they are alive, they will always "expand their territory", spread to other parts of the body through the blood, lymphatic system, or other channels, and then find a suitable part to "set up". Clinically, patients are most afraid of hearing doctors say that cancer has metastasized, because this means that the difficulty of treatment has increased.

Among them, bone metastasis is very common in cancer metastasis. Bone metastasis refers to the process by which cancer cells reach the bones through blood or other means, grow in the bones and destroy normal bone tissue and bone metabolism.
Data show that the incidence of bone metastasis accounts for 15% to 20% of systemic metastatic cancers, and it is the third most common cancer metastasis site after lung and liver.
In this regard, experts say that cancer cells are osteophilic. Bone is a place where cells continue to grow. In addition, bone cells release some substances that accelerate the growth of cancer cells. If cancer cells are seeds, then bones are fertile soil.
Therefore, cancer cells have a soft spot for bones. When cancer cells take root in the bones, they secrete a large number of cytokines to stimulate the formation of osteoclasts, resulting in a balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and eventually a series of bone metastasis complications.
What signals does the body have when bone metastases?
Almost all cancers may have bone metastases, among which breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer and kidney cancer have a higher incidence. The most common bone metastases are the bones near the middle, the spine, and the upper arm bones, thigh bones, ribs, hip bones, and skull.

When bone metastasis occurs, in addition to symptoms at the original site, it also causes a series of discomforts:
1. Bone pain
Tumors continue to grow in the bones and will expand and stimulate the periosteum to produce pain. This is the most typical symptom of bone metastasis. Bone pain develops quickly, and the pain gradually worsens, most intensely at night. The pain is mainly concentrated in the waist, chest and back, rib chest or neck. When bone pain occurs, the patient is often so painful that he is helpless, and taking painkillers will not help.
2. Pathological fracture
Bone metastasis can damage the bones and cause bone fractures. After a bone fracture, once strenuous activities, or falls, or even daily activities, etc., it is easy to cause pathological fractures.
3. Spinal cord compression
When cancer cells spread to the spine, it can cause compression of the spinal cord, causing pain or increased pain in the back and neck, numbness of the limbs, and weakness. If it is not treated in time, it will cause nerve damage, and severely cause paralysis.
4. Hypercalcemia
Cancer bone metastasis will cause calcium in the bones to leak out and flow into the blood, leading to excessive calcium levels in the blood and hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. In severe cases, it can lead to coma.

Is there any rescue after cancer bone metastasis?
In the past, patients were frightened when they heard about bone metastasis of cancer. Because of the limited medical treatment, after bone metastasis of cancer, it was equivalent to being sentenced to death. In recent years, more and more studies and clinical trials have shown that even if cancer bone metastases occur, patients can still survive scientifically to prolong their survival and achieve long-term survival with tumors.
At present, the most urgent clinical problem that needs to be solved after cancer bone metastasis is the pain of bone metastasis. Facing bone pain, the first reaction of some patients is forbearance. It must be noted that bone pain cannot be tolerated and should be treated actively. Through symptomatic and supportive treatment, analgesic drug therapy, bisphosphonate therapy, radiotherapy, surgical treatment and other methods, it can effectively relieve bone pain, improve the patient's functional status and quality of life, reduce the risk of complications, and achieve minimal trauma化.
How can cancer patients avoid cancer metastasis?
Once the cancer has metastasized, it is very detrimental to the patient's recovery. Therefore, in the process of treatment, patients must be adequately prepared to avoid cancer metastasis.
First of all, we must pay attention to comprehensive treatment. No single treatment method can guarantee the cure of cancer. The vast majority need comprehensive treatment. Some patients have to undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Some patients are intolerant of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and require treatment with Chinese medicine. However, no matter which treatment method is adopted, the premise is that it must be scientific, and you must not listen to secret prescriptions and folk prescriptions.
Second, we must pay attention to self-examination and review. On the one hand, pay attention to observe whether there are lumps, ulcers, and symptoms of discomfort throughout the body. If there are abnormalities, seek medical attention in time. On the other hand, regular check-ups are indispensable, helping to detect early metastasis of cancer and take timely measures.

Finally, we must develop good living habits, eat less salt, limit the intake of red meat and processed meat, eat more high-quality protein and fresh fruits and vegetables, and eat grains and whole grains in moderation. At the same time maintain a positive and optimistic attitude, adhere to regular exercise, actively improve the body's immunity, and reduce the risk of cancer metastasis.
The survey shows that within 5 years after cancer surgery, cancer recurrence and metastasis are most likely to occur. When the cancer recurs or metastasizes, it means that the difficulty of retreatment will be greatly increased, and the treatment effect will not be as good as before. Therefore, for cancer patients, the fight against cancer is a protracted battle. In addition to actively conditioning the body after the operation, we must also pay close attention to the body's dynamics. Once the signs of cancer metastasis are found, there is no delay in the moment, and you must see a doctor as soon as possible..</p>

      <h3>caution! These 9 diseases have miraculous effects in seeing Chinese medicine! Don't go to the hospital again！</h3>
      <p contenteditable>


Seeing a doctor is most afraid of "emergency medical treatment"! Although Chinese and Western medicine have similar curative effects on many diseases, for some specific fields, Chinese and Western medicine does have some treatments that they are good at. Mastering the laws can make it more convenient to choose Chinese and Western medicine.

6 kinds of diseases are most suitable for Chinese medicine

01 allergic diseases

Normal immunity is moderate and timely. If the regulation is abnormal, an abnormal immune response will occur, which will lead to damage to the body and the formation of new diseases.

For example, eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, etc., are generally caused by immune disorders.

Because the immune system has the characteristics of causing the whole body to be affected, it is difficult to find the specificity with western medicine, and it can only suppress the immune function, and it is easy to repeat after stopping the medicine.

However, traditional Chinese medicine is to adjust from the local area, and it can often achieve good results.

02 Gynecological diseases

Gynecological diseases are often caused by hormone secretion disorders. If you simply regulate a certain hormone, not only is it difficult to control the dosage, but it is also easy to cause a series of hormone changes in the body. However, Chinese medicine has a unique curative effect on this.

Especially in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, infertility, breast hyperplasia, premature ovarian failure, polycystic ovary syndrome, menopausal syndrome, functional uterine bleeding and other diseases, often effective.

03 Andrology Diseases

For male diseases such as impotence, premature ejaculation and benign prostatic hyperplasia, traditional Chinese medicine also has a good therapeutic effect.

04 Shoulder, neck, waist and leg pain

Massage, acupuncture, Chinese medicine, etc. can improve blood circulation, promote inflammation subsidence and functional recovery.

05 Spleen and stomach disease

Such as chronic gastritis, abdominal distension, loose stools, etc., generally have a longer course of disease and more complicated mechanisms. Western medicine is mostly single-component, which is not as targeted as traditional Chinese medicine.

06 Respiratory system diseases

Traditional Chinese medicine is often referred to as "slow herbalist", but this view is not completely correct. Cough, tonsillitis, bronchitis and other diseases are also suitable for Chinese medicine treatment, and antibiotics can be avoided.

07 Complex chronic diseases

As we all know, Chinese medicine has an exclusive advantage in the treatment of chronic diseases

Especially in the treatment of hepatitis, nephritis, bronchitis, chronic enteritis, gastritis, emphysema, anemia, diabetic complications and senile diseases, it is difficult for modern medicine to exert its advantages.

Traditional Chinese medicine can adjust the balance of qi and blood, Yin and Yang, and improve the health of the body.

08 functional diseases

Many people often experience physical discomforts such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, heart palpitations, chest tightness, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression and various unexplained pains, but the inspection indicators are normal.

We usually call it a sub-health state, and it is particularly suitable for the use of Chinese medicine theories to treat the disease, and the effect is remarkable.

09 After the initial recovery

Whether it is physical weakness after a serious illness or limb hemiplegia and cognitive impairment after a stroke, it is the strength of TCM treatment.

In addition, there are neurological diseases such as facial paralysis, neurological deafness, tinnitus, and neuropathic pain, which are all suitable for treatment by Chinese medicine. The earlier acupuncture treatment is involved, the better the effect.

I'm most afraid of you doing these things when I see a Chinese doctor

Observing, hearing, and asking is the basis of TCM treatment of diseases. If you do the following six things before seeing a doctor, it may cause the doctor to misdiagnose!

01I'm afraid you put on makeup

Inspection is very important for diagnosis. Although makeup can give you a "good look", it also adds a "protective cover" to the disease, making it difficult for doctors to judge the condition through inspection.

Therefore, you must not put on makeup before seeing a Chinese medicine doctor, and ensure that you have a pure face so that the doctor can see your "as it is".

02 Afraid of eating indiscriminately

Looking at the tongue picture is also an important method for TCM physicians to judge the condition. If you eat and drink indiscriminately before seeing the doctor, it is likely that the tongue picture will change, which will also affect the diagnosis.

For example, milk, peanuts and other fatty foods can easily make your tongue coating white and greasy; coffee, oranges, and vitamin B2 can make your tongue coating yellow; drinking hot drinks just before going to the doctor can make your tongue red.

Therefore, before seeing a Chinese medicine doctor, you must not eat randomly, especially foods with pigments.

03 afraid of you spraying perfume

Many diseases have abnormal breath or body odor.

Therefore, do not use strong perfume or skin care products; do not eat strong odor foods, such as onions, garlic, etc., so as not to affect the accuracy of smell and diagnosis.

04 Afraid of your strenuous exercise

Pulse diagnosis is an important method of Chinese medicine diagnosis. Before seeing a doctor, you should try to keep your mood calm and avoid factors such as emotional irritability and strenuous exercise.

05 Afraid you don't trust

The treatment of many diseases takes a certain amount of time. If you are anxious for success and frequently change doctors, it will disrupt the doctor's treatment rhythm.

It is recommended that there is no obvious effect after treatment for 1 to 2 months, and you can consider changing the treatment method.

06 I'm afraid you won't cooperate

In the process of diagnosis and treatment, Chinese medicine attaches great importance to individual differences in physique. The cause, time, place, and performance of the disease are different, and the prescriptions will be different.

Unless the doctor allows it, please do not follow the previous prescription or the prescription of others. It is the best cooperation to follow the doctor's advice carefully.</p>
